**`Digital Wizerd (Leader | Creator | Student)`**

I am a digital developer and cybersecurity security student. I create side projects to make my life easier and also create anything that makes me happy. Here on my github you will find all the fun projects I work on in my free time to keep me busy outside of my security day job and classes. If you see something you like clone it and make it your own.

 <summary><h3>Origin Story</h3></summary>
When I first started school I was a business student studying entrepreneurship and management. I love business found all the classes extremely interesting especially all of the case studies we had on the leaders of the companies. These leaders had an impact on me. I wanted to be like them and be at the head of my own empire. Then as I was walking though a society fair the cybersecurity society representative gave me a cart to their in-house CTF challenge. Computers were definitely something I liked using and after that first CTF I was hooked. I fell head over heals for cybersecurity and opened up a passion I did not know I had. Business leadership is still something I love and I am still working on becoming the head of my own empire but now that company might be a raging cybersecurity security company defending and attacking the biggest businesses of my generation.
